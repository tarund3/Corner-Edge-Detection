# Lines and Corners Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script for detecting lines and corners in an image using OpenCV. The program reads an image, detects edges, applies the Hough Transform to find line segments, and uses the Harris Corner Detector to identify corners. The final result is an image that highlights the detected lines in green and the corners in red.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lines-corners-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your image in the project directory.
2. In the Python script, set the `file_path` variable to the path of your image file.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter or in Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
python detect_lines_and_corners.py
```

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. Image Loading

The script first loads the image using OpenCV's `cv2.imread()` function in grayscale mode.

```python
image_path = '/content/my_image_opencv.jpg'
image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
```

### 2. Canny Edge Detection

The edges in the image are detected using the Canny Edge Detector:

```python
edges = cv2.Canny(image, 100, 200)
```

### 3. Line Detection

The Hough Line Transform (`cv2.HoughLinesP`) is applied to the edge-detected image to find line segments:

```python
lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(edges, rho=1, theta=np.pi/180, threshold=100, minLineLength=50, maxLineGap=10)
```

### 4. Corner Detection

The Harris Corner Detector is used to find corners in the image:

```python
corners = cv2.cornerHarris(image, blockSize=2, ksize=3, k=0.04)
```

### 5. Visualization

The detected lines and corners are drawn on the original image, with lines in green and corners in red.

```python
output_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
for line in lines:
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = line[0]
    cv2.line(output_image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

output_image[corners_dilated > 0.01 * corners_dilated.max()] = [0, 0, 255]
```

Finally, the result is displayed using Matplotlib:

```python
plt.imshow(output_image)
plt.title('Lines and Corners Detection')
plt.show()
```

## Example

Here's an example of an image before and after applying the detection algorithm:
